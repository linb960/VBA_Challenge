# VBA Refactoring Challenge
## Overview
#### The purpose of this project is to gain insight into how refactoring code can affect the run time of the code.  The challenge builds upon a project that took input from spreadsheets which contained over 3000 lines of information regarding twelve different stocks.  In the initial project there was a loop run inside of a loop.  By using arrays to capture the data only one loop was needed to output the results.  The initial project and the challenge captured the time the code ran to determine if refactoring improves the run time.
